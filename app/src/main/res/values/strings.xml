\n2003: City score 106 goals in a hugely entertaining season in Division Two but miss out on automatic promotion by three points to Crewe Alexandra. In the play-off semi-finals City are narrowly beaten by local rivals Cardiff City by one goal to nil on aggregate.

\n2004: City finish third in the table, missing out on automatic promotion by just one point to Queens Park Rangers, despite recording a post-war club record 11 successive League wins between December-February and boasting the joint-meanest defensive record in the Football League with Doncaster Rovers. After a memorable play-off semi-final win over Hartlepool United, they lose 1-0 to Brighton in the play-off final at the Millennium Stadium.

\n2006: Former Premiership star Marcus Stewart signs for City, his boyhood club – one of seven summer signings; but a disappointing start to the season sees Brian Tinnion step down as manager in September after a 7-1 defeat at Swansea leaves City one point off the bottom of the table. Yeovil Town boss Gary Johnson is appointed manager on 23rd September. City are steered to safety and eventually finish ninth.

\n2007: City finally clinch promotion back to the Championship with a second placed finish. A victory on the final day of the season, 3-1 over Rotherham United, spark mass celebrations in the city and a memorable pitch invasion. Lee Trundle becomes only the club’s third £1 million signing when he arrives from Swansea in August

\n2008: City’s first season back in the Championship sees them reach their highest league placing for 32 years, finishing fourth in the table. After beating Crystal Palace in a pulsating two-legged play-off semi-final, ending in extra-time at a packed Ashton Gate, the season ends in heartbreak with a 1-0 play-off final defeat to Hull City in front of 86,703 at Wembley. Player-of-the-year: Adriano Basso. Leading scorer: Darren Byfield. In August club chairman Steve Lansdown smashes the club’s transfer record to allow Gary Johnson to buy Crewe striker Nicky Maynard for £2.5 million, The clubs announces it wishes to move to a new purpose-built 30,000-seat stadium at nearby Ashton Vale by 2012.

\n2009: City rally after a disappointing first half of the season to briefly challenge for the play-offs before finishing tenth. City’s new stadium project plays a leading role in Bristol being named as one of 12 candidate host cities by England’s 2018 World Cup bid team.

\n2010: After a promising start to the campaign, City tailed off towards the lower half of the table. In March Gary Johnson made an emotional farewell by mutual consent following a 3-2 defeat at Plymouth Argyle. Keith Millen, formerly Gary’s assistant, stepped up to become caretaker manager for the remainder of the campaign. Nicky Maynard was the division’s joint top scorer with 20 goals (21 in all competitions) and his goals proved vital. In the end City finished in tenth position once more. Bristolian Cole Skuse won the player of the year award, with Nicky Maynard as young player again. Steve Coppell was appointed as the club’s next manager, beginning his reign in 2010/11. However, the former Reading manager’s spell lasted just two games – both defeats – as he resigned and retired from football management altogether. Keith Millen took over on a three-year contract. A roller coaster season saw many peaks and troughs before a mid-table finish.

\n2011: Millen’s men stuttered from the start and, with just one win to the team’s name by October, a 5-0 drubbing at Blackpool ended his reign. In stepped Derek McInnes, from St Johnstone, and the Scot battled through a host of poor spells to secure the team’s survival in the Championship for another season. A pitch invasion followed the 2-0 win over Barnsley at Ashton Gate in April, the day safety was assured.

\n2012: McInnes’ turnaround of the club failed to materialise though. He battled on, despite seven straight defeats in the league. By January, with the team bottom of the table and thrashed 4-0 at home by Leicester City, McInnes was dismissed. In days Sean O’Driscoll took on the head coach’s role, but even his initial upturn – three wins from five games – couldn’t prevent City from the drop.

\n2013: With a fresh new approach, looking at younger players in a different recruitment policy, also working to a more realistic wage structure, O’Driscoll took City into the new League One campaign. The Robins struggled with life back in the third tier and after a run of just two wins in 18 matches and the club rooted in relegation zone the club parted company with O’Driscoll. Steve Cotterill was appointed as manager on a three-and-a-half year deal. An impressive run at the end of the 2013/14 campaign saw the Robins suffer just one defeat in their last 13 outings which meant City’s League One status was secured.

\n2014: City recruited superbly and enjoyed one of the best campaigns in their history, storming to the League One title with an incredible haul of 99 points and also landing the Johnstone’s Paint Trophy in front of 40,000 City supporters at Wembley. It ended City’s two-year stay outside of the Championship.

\n2015: The team found transition to life in the Championship tough and Cotterill was replaced by Lee Johnson in February, following a brief spell with John Pemberton in temporary charge. A strong second half of the season saw City finish 18th in the table, a full 12 points clear of the dropzone. The South Stand was opened to the public for the first time, as Ashton Gate’s changing face continued.

\n2016: With the stadium now fully opened, City began the season strongly, beating newly-promoted pair Wigan Athletic and Burton Albion, along with Aston Villa at Ashton Gate. However, a dip in form from October saw the team drop down the table. A club record eight straight defeats left Johnson’s men fighting another relegation battle. A bold shake-up of the coaching staff, seeing Pemberton depart and be replaced by Jamie McAllister, led to an upturn in fortunes. City secured their safety with a game to spare after beating Premier League-bound Brighton and Hove Albion on their own patch.

\n2017: Bristol City knock Manchester United out of the Carabao Cup, with a 2-1 win at Ashton Gate. Joe Bryan scored first, with Korey Smith netting an injury-time winner.

\n2020: The Covid-19 pandemic forces the 2019/20 season to be temporarily suspended, before the game’s return behind closed doors. Lee Johnson departs during the resumption of the 2019/20 campaign, after a 1-0 defeat to Cardiff City. Dean Holden was promoted from Assistant Head Coach role ahead of the 2020/21 season.

\n2021: After a promising start to the campaign City struggle on the pitch with Holden replaced by Nigel Pearson in February. Pearson oversees the remainder of the campaign, signing a three-year contract in the summer.
